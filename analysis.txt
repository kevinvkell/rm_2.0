I made a shell script that used the date feature to time operations. you can see the
script and sample output in test.sh and test.txt. 

I got the date before and after each operation, and repeated this in a for loop 100 
times for each operation. when completed i calculated averages and put them in the 
output file.

The average rename and the average move (as can be seen in the output in ns)
added together is what you would expect the averate rm -r to be, but it was actually 
shorte thatn that in practice...I think this is because ./rm wasn't working correctly
